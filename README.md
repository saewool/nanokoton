# nanokoton
A very very small kernel.
I cant do that much because im just begining with kernel developing. Some library just dummy library because I can't write that.
btw this is a free kernel for everyone
missing things:
syscall
vfs
slab allocator
pci manager
keyboard & mouse driver
pit & apic timer
standard library
